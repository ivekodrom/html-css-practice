    <p><strong>A CSS pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected
            element(s). For example, ::first-line can be used to change the font of the first line of a paragraph.
            Note: As a rule, double colons (::) should be used instead of a single colon (:). This distinguishes
            pseudo-classes from pseudo-elements. However, since this distinction was not present in older versions of
            the W3C spec, most browsers support both syntaxes for the original pseudo-elements.

    <p>rthur Sullivan (1896–1937) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross. Born in South Australia, Sullivan
        enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force during World War I. Sent to the United Kingdom, he completed training
        after the Armistice came into effect. Wanting to see active service, he sought his discharge and enlisted in the
        British Army with the North Russia Relief Force, part of the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. In
        the early morning of 11 August 1919 he was a member of a rearguard withdrawing across the Sheika River in North
        Russia. As his platoon crossed the river on a one-plank bridge, it came under intense fire from Bolshevik
        troops, and four men fell into the river. Sullivan jumped in and rescued all four, one by one; he was awarded
        the Victoria Cross for his actions. He was part of the Australian Coronation Contingent in London for the
        coronation of King George VI in 1937 when he died of head injuries received in a fall. (Full article...)
