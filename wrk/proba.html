        The ring ouzel (Turdus torquatus) is a medium-sized thrush, breeding mainly in Europe. Males are mostly black
        with a white crescent across the breast, females are browner and duller than males, and young birds may lack
        chest markings. A high-altitude bird, it breeds in open mountain areas with some trees or shrubs, often
        including heather or juniper. It is migratory, wintering in southern Europe, northern Africa and Turkey, often
        in mountains with juniper. A typical clutch of three to six brown-flecked pale blue or greenish eggs is
        incubated by the female and hatches after 13 days. The downy chicks fledge in another 14 days. The thrush is
        omnivorous, eating invertebrates, particularly insects and earthworms, some small vertebrates, and a wide range
        of fruit. Most animal prey is caught on the ground. With an extensive range and a large population, the ring
        ouzel is evaluated as a least-concern species by the IUCN. There are declines in several countries, perhaps due
        to climate change or human disturbance.
